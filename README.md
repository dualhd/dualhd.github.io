# Dual HD
Specifications for frame sizes used in simultaneous horizontal and vertical video streaming: [Dualhd.org](https://dualhd.org/).

Dual HD is a set of frame sizes designed to simplify live streaming across platforms with different device orientations. It enables creators to stream horizontal and vertical video formats simultaneously, streamlining content creation for platforms like Twitch and YouTube (horizontal) and TikTok and Instagram (vertical). This format enhances the viewing experience across devices without requiring multiple separate streams.

Dual HD focuses solely on frame sizes, not codecs or other technical details. However, modern codecs like AV1 are recommended to efficiently manage bandwidth despite the larger frame size.

This project is supported by [Streamrun](https://streamrun.com/), enabling Dual HD multistreaming in landscape and portrait modes to platforms such as Twitch/YouTube (horizontal) and TikTok/Instagram (vertical).
